		    <summary>STEP 1→
			Meet Our Representative:</summary>
			<p>We get things rolling by setting up a meeting with our Customer Experience Specialist (CES). You can opt for an online video consultation or a face-to-face meeting. If you do choose to meet in person, please note that it will be contingent on the on-ground situation and in accordance with the government’s COVID-19 directives. At this stage, the CES gets a thorough understanding of your interior design needs, tastes and preferences. He also explains our process in detail, from conceptualising and designing to executing the house design.</p>
		</details>	
		
		<details>
		    <summary>STEP 2→
			First, the Discussion, then the Visualisation:</summary>
			<p>In the 2nd meeting, our expert interior designer will show you possible designs based on your requirements, preferences and latest trends. Once we have your preferences identified, we move on to 3D visualisation using our state-of-the-art 3D visualiser. The 3D visualiser will help you accurately understand the home design and make changes to it before the actual work begins.</p>
		</details>	
		
		<details>
		    <summary>STEP 3→
			Design Finalisation:</summary>
			<p>At this stage, we will share the 2D design along with the 3D visualiser output with you. We are happy to make changes till we have a design that matches your taste and liking. Once the design is finalized, our CES will share the quotation with you.

            Payment milestone 1: The payment at this stage is the site booking charge and is equal to 15% of the quotation value shared.
            </p>
		</details>	
		
		<details>
		    <summary>STEP 4→
			Material Selection and Process Signoff:</summary>
			<p>Once the site is booked, the CES starts work, beginning with the selection of materials, including fabrics, lightings and other décor elements. Our project manager chalks out a comprehensive schedule to ensure that the work is completed on time and to your specifications. At this stage, the CES also shares the relevant documents for final approval — all 2D working drawings, finalized 3D designs, the quotation, the timeline, work schedule and material list. Before we start with material procurement and site construction, your second payment milestone is due.

            Payment Milestone 2: This amounts to 55% of the updated quotation.</p>
		</details>
		
		
		<details>
		    <summary>STEP 5→
			Construction and Site Installation:</summary>
			<p>This is where you relax, and we do all the heavy lifting. The CES ensures the professional execution of your project. We keep you informed with regular updates about the progress being made. The third payment milestone is due at this stage before the final installation and completion of work on-site.

            Payment Milestone 3: Balance amount due.</p>
		</details>
		
		
		<details>
		    <summary>STEP 6→
			The Handover—and a Beautiful Home:</summary>
			<p>Once completed, the CES takes you on a walk-through of your house, explaining the details of the interior design. He hands over all the necessary documents to you at this stage. He also updates you on the measures to take care of the space and leaves you with the assurance of any timely support you might need in the future. And with that, you get to enjoy and experience your newly designed beautiful home!</p>
